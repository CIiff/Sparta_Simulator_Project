# Sparta Simulator Project

This project is a Python package that allows users to simulate the growth of the Sparta Global Academy.<br>

The App will prompt the user to input the number of months they would like to simulate as well as the number of trainees
they would like to generate per month and output the following:<br>


1. Number of centres by centre type (Training Hub, Bootcamp and Tech Centre) and status (full, open or closed).
2. Number of trainees currently training on which course (Data, DevOps, C#, Java and Business).
3. Number of trainees on the waiting list, number of trainees who have graduated and are 'benched', and the number of
trainees who are working with a client.


The user can also specify if they would like to view the information month by month or as a final result after their 
specified months.

## Prerequisites

Before you continue, ensure you have met the following requirements:

* You have installed the latest version of Python.

2. Open the 'config.ini' file and input the following:

   * The number of months you would like the simulator to run for
   * The minimum number of trainees to generate per month
   * The maximum number of trainees to generate per month
   * Specify the login_type as 'DEBUG' to view a month by month output or 'INFO' for a final output.
