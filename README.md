# Sparta Simulator Project

This project is a Python package that allows users to simulate the growth of the Sparta Global Academy.<br>

The App will prompt the user to input the number of months they would like to simulate for and output the following:<br>

<ol>
<li>Number of open centres </li> 
<li>Number of full centres </li> 
<li>Number of trainees currently training </li> 
<li>Number of trainees on the waiting list </li> 
</ol>

End users can enter the number of months they would like the simulator to run for in the 'config' file. They should then run the simulator through the 'main' file.
